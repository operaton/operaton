**Dependency to upgrade**

Upgrade [<DependencyName> to <y.y.y>](<link_to_release)

Current version: `<x.x.x>`

**Impact**

- Only test dependency: <YES,NO>
<!-- For test dependencies: n/a -->
- Affected distros: <n/a,Tomcat,Wildfly,Standalone>

**Verify**

Run a full build with:
```
./mvnw clean verify
```

Listing the project dependencies should only reference the upgraded dependency version. Execute:
```bash
./.devenv/scripts/tools/list-unique-dependencies.sh
```

Alternatively, you can use the `./mvnw dependency:tree > dependencies.txt` command to see the dependency tree 
and ensure that the upgraded dependency is correctly included.
