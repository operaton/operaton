# About release 1.0.0

This is the first official, stable release of Operaton. After forking the [Camunda 7 platform](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform) in 2024, 
we have been working hard to modernize the code base and prepare for the 1.0.0 stable release.

Several beta releases have been published to gather feedback from the community and ensure a smooth 
transition. Multiple products have already started to use Operaton in production, and even
more are actively testing it. Major effort has been put into **automated testing to ensure stability
and reliability**.

From now on, Operaton is the successor to the open-source BPM platform formerly known as 
_Camunda 7 Community Edition_ (archived on Nov 4th 2025). 
The engine is already battle-tested in production environments,
and is safe to transition from existing Camunda 7 CE installations.
It is important to note that Operaton focuses on the core BPM/CMMN/DMN engine and its related components.

We are excited to embark on this new journey and look forward to building a vibrant 
community around Operaton. We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration from developers
worldwide. Together, we can shape the future of business process management with Operaton!

## 🛠️ Migration from Camunda 7 CE

Migrating from Camunda 7 Community Edition to Operaton is straightforward. Operaton 1.0 is fully 
compatible with Camunda 7.24, allowing for a seamless transition. We recommend upgrading to 
Camunda 7.24 first, and then switch to Operaton 1.0.

Migration involves updating your dependencies to point to Operaton artifacts instead of Camunda ones.
We provide a migration based on OpenRewrite to help automate this process. You can find the migration recipe
in our [Operaton Migration Repository](https://github.com/operaton/migrate-from-camunda-recipe).

this might not work with the GraalVM JavaScript engine. 
Please check your JavaScript code and consider migrating them to a more recent version of JavaScript.
