## Our Process

As a volunteer-driven project, we cannot guarantee strict timelines. However, we will:

- Acknowledge your report as quickly as possible (usually within a few days)
- Investigate the issue and keep you updated on progress
- Prepare a fix and release it in a new version once ready
- Publish an advisory with details and credit to reporters who request it
- Please note that fixes may require coordination with upstream dependencies or related projects.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until we have released a fix.

## Scope

This policy applies to vulnerabilities in the Operaton source code, builds, and official release
artifacts.

Out-of-scope examples include:

- Denial of service through excessive traffic
- Issues in third-party dependencies (please report upstream)
- Social engineering or attacks against project members
- Vulnerabilities requiring privileged local access without privilege escalation

## Coordinated Disclosure

We ask that you do not publicly disclose details of a vulnerability until:

A fix has been released, and
An advisory has been published.
This helps protect users by giving them time to update.
