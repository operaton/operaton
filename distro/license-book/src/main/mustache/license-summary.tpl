## Licenses for Third-Party Libraries
The following sections contain licensing information for third-party libraries that we distribute with the Operaton source code and binaries for your convenience. None of the Libraries are modified or changed and they are solely distributed as is. For practicality, the license text is only referenced once. Each library (whether provided in source or object form) is licensed to you by its copyright holders under the original open source license listed in this License Book. Nothing in this License Book or any license agreement we enter into with you removes or restricts any rights you may have in respect of any component under its original open source license, or makes any of the original authors or copyright holders of the component liable to you in respect of your use or distribution of that component.

We are thankful to all individuals that have created these.

The Libraries used within Operaton {{version}} are published under the following licenses:

{{#license_ids}}

GNU Lesser/Library General Public License LGPL (any version)

Where the Operaton binaries contain components licensed under any version of LGPL, that licence allows you to extract the object code of the LGPL component from the binary as distributed by us (this is normally distributed as a compressed .tar.gz file which contains a number of files, such as .jar files which are themselves archives containing further components, all of which can be extracted using commonly available tools such as gzip). Using the source code of the library (which we will provide on request, or you can download it from the location specified in this license book), you can make modifications or bug fixes to the library, recompile the library (again, using commonly available tools) and replace the binary of the library you extracted with the recompiled object code. Full details of this process are available on request. This will enable you to modify any LGPL-licensed library and re-integrate that modified library into the Operaton binaries (accepting that this will only work provided you have not broken the library or the interface).
