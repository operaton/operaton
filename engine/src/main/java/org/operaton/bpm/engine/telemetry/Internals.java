   *       It is then only used by the telemetry Query API that returns the currently collected
   *       data but sending telemetry to Operaton is disabled.</li>
   *   <li>When sending telemetry to Operaton is enabled after engine start via API (e.g.,
   *       {@link ManagementService#toggleTelemetry(boolean)}. This call causes the engine to wipe
   *       all dynamic data and therefore the collection date is reset to the current time.</li>
   *   <li>When sending telemetry to Operaton is enabled, after sending the data, all existing dynamic
   *       data is wiped and therefore the collection date is reset to the current time.</li>
