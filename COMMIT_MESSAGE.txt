chore(engine-dmn): format DMN test files with consistent XML indentation

Format all DMN test files in hitpolicy directories with consistent XML
formatting to improve readability and maintainability.

Changes:
- Format 26 DMN files in engine/src/test/resources/org/operaton/bpm/dmn/engine/hitpolicy
- Format 10 DMN files in engine/src/test/resources/org/operaton/bpm/dmn/engine/impl/hitpolicy
- Apply consistent 2-space indentation throughout all files
- Ensure proper XML declaration and newline at end of file
- Normalize namespace prefixes for consistency

All files maintain their original functionality and content while
following consistent XML formatting standards.
