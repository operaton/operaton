## JUnit 5 migration

We have continued to migrate tests to JUnit 5. The migration is not yet complete, but we are making
steady progress.

Especially worth mentioning is that the tests of the most complex module, `engine`,
has been completed.

49/53 (+5) modules have been migrated to JUnit 5.

## Customizable Model Singletons

BPMN, CMMN, and DMN singletons are now loaded via factories discovered with `ServiceLoader`, allowing custom implementations.
To override, create an implementation of desired factory and register it in corresponding file in `META-INF/services`.
